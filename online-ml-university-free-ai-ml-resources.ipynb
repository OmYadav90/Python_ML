NLP techniques involve parsing sentences, extracting relevant information, analyzing grammatical structures, and building language models to process and generate text. For example, in chatbots or virtual assistants, NLP enables the system to understand user queries, extract intent and entities, and generate appropriate responses, providing natural and interactive conversations with users. NLP plays a vital role in various applications such as customer support, information retrieval, content generation, and automated language translation.\n\n| Source | Course Code | Course Name | Session | Difficulty | URL |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stanford | Stanford CS224N | Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning | Winter 2021 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rmVRLeJRkl4&list=PLoROMvodv4rOSH4v6133s9LFPRHjEmbmJ&pp=iAQB) |\n| Stanford | Stanford CS224U | Natural Language Understanding | Spring 2021 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=rha64cQRLs8&list=PLoROMvodv4rPt5D0zs3YhbWSZA8Q_DyiJ&pp=iAQB) |\n| Stanford | Stanford CS25 |  Transformers United | N/A | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNiJRchCzutFw5ItR_Z27CM) |\n| Carnegie Mellon University | CS/LTI 11-711 | Advanced NLP                                          | |‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtube](https://lnkd.in/gSt29ZVt)      |\n| Carnegie Mellon University | CS/LTI 11-747 | Neural Networks for NLP                               | |‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtube](https://lnkd.in/gRRrY8uq)      |\n| Carnegie Mellon University | CS/LTI 11-737 | Multilingual NLP                                      | |‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  | [Youtube](https://lnkd.in/g8QkaTfy)      |\n| Carnegie Mellon University | CS/LTI Bootcamp| Low Resource NLP Bootcamp 2020 by Graham Neubig       | |‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê| [Youtube](https://lnkd.in/grYqa3YZ)     |\n| Hugging Face| |  NLP | | ‚≠ê| [Link (Free)](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/1) |\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:6px;color:white;margin:0;font-size:200%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:4px;background-color:#4D4D4D;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500;border: 5px solid #292929;\">\nTime Series/Audio/Speech Processing</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **8. üìâ Time Series/Audio/Speech Processing**\nTime Series/Audio/Speech Processing is a specialized field in computer science and signal processing that focuses on analyzing, manipulating, and extracting useful information from time-varying signals such as audio and speech data.

These systems learn patterns from existing data and use that knowledge to create new instances resembling the training data. Techniques include generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and autoregressive models. For example, a generative AI model trained on landscape photos can generate new images resembling natural scenery. In music, generative AI can compose original melodies or entire pieces based on a given style or genre. Generative AI unlocks creativity and innovation by enabling machines to autonomously generate novel content.\n\n| Source | Course Name | Difficulty | URL |\n| --- | --- |  --- | --- |\n| Microsoft and Linkedin Learning | Career Essentials in Generative AI by Microsoft and LinkedIn         | ‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/career-essentials-in-generative-ai-by-microsoft-and-linkedin)           |\n| Google |  Generative AI learning path       | ‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/journeys/118)           |\n| DeepLearning.AI |  ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers       | ‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)           |\n| DeepLearning.AI |  LangChain for LLM Application Development       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)           |\n| DeepLearning.AI |  How Diffusion Models Work       | ‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)           |\n| DeepLearning.AI |  Building Systems with the ChatGPT API       | ‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/)           |\n| Weights and Biases | Building LLM-Powered Apps | ‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/building-llm-powered-apps)           |\n| Weights and Biases | Training and Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) | ‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://www.wandb.courses/courses/training-fine-tuning-LLMs) |\n| Prompt Engineering | Prompt Engineering Guide | ‚≠ê | [Website](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) |\n| The Full Stack | LLM Bootcamp - Spring 2023 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | [YT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1T8fO7ArWleyIqOy37OVXsP4hFXymdOZ) |\n| Databricks | Large Language Models (LLMs): Application through Production | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://customer-academy.databricks.com/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/1749/large-language-models-llms-application-through-production) |\n| ActiveLoop | LangChain & Vector Databases in Production | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Link (Free)](https://learn.activeloop.ai/courses/langchain) |\n| Cohere | LLM in Production | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtuve](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3vkEKxWd-us5YvvuvYkjP_QGlgUq3tpA) |","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:6px;color:white;margin:0;font-size:200%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:4px;background-color:#4D4D4D;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500;border: 5px solid #292929;\">\nGraph Neural Networks</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **11. üìå Graph Neural Networks**\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks specifically designed to operate on graph-structured data. Graphs consist of nodes (also known as vertices) connected by edges, representing relationships or interactions between entities. GNNs aim to leverage the structural information within the graph to perform tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph generation. GNNs operate by propagating and aggregating information across the graph using neural network layers. Each node in the graph captures information from its neighboring nodes, allowing for learning and representation of complex patterns and dependencies within the graph structure. \n\n| Source | Course Code | Course Name | Session | Difficulty | URL |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stanford University| Stanford CS224W | Machine Learning with Graphs | N/A | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&pp=iAQB) |\n| African Master in Machine Intelligence | | Geometric Deep Learning Oxford-NYU-Qualcomm-DeepMind                   |   2022   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLHTzKZzVU9e6xUfG10TkTWApKSZCzuBI) |\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div style=\"padding:6px;color:white;margin:0;font-size:200%;text-align:center;display:fill;border-radius:4px;background-color:#4D4D4D;overflow:hidden;font-weight:500;border: 5px solid #292929;\">\nMachine Learning Operations (MLOps)</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **12. ‚öôÔ∏è MLOps**\nMLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, refers to the practices and processes implemented to streamline the deployment, management, and scaling of machine learning models in production environments.
